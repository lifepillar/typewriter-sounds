# Typewriter Sounds

Some typewriter sounds, collected from different sources. These are meant to be
used with my Vim plugin [KeySound](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-keysound).
The sounds have been converted to WAV format when the source was in a different
format. The filenames have also been renamed.
